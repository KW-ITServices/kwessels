            <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
            <p>
              I’m Kyle, an Operations and IT professional with over a decade of
              experience spanning systems administration, field operations,
              technical support, and service delivery. In my recent role, I led
              Field Engineers across multiple regions, improved team
              productivity, strengthened SLA compliance, and enhanced IT
              operations through standardized processes and continuous
              improvement. I’ve worked extensively across Windows environments,
              Microsoft 365, Active Directory, networking and system
              — and I’ve led operational projects including
              infrastructure optimization, policy refinement, incident
              management, and cross-team technical coordination.
